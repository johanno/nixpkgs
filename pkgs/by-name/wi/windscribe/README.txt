OK this is my try at getting windscribe client to work on nixos.

https://github.com/Windscribe/Desktop-App

In the top folder I tried to build it from sources. It fails on an weird c error I can't figure out.

In the deb folder I tried to get the ubuntu package working. I almost got there. However the Gui just hangs for no apparent reason. I can't debug it any further.
The def.nix file is the one that is the almost finished one.
